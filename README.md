# tic-tac-toe
It's the tic-tac-toe project from the JS course.

12/21/2023 10:45 AM. It works as specified in the instructions. The issue is that it won't reset the game when the 'start' button is pressed. If the start button is pressed right after a game it appears to start a new game while the first one is still in progress. That's a problem to solve in the future. In the meantime, I'll mark it as complete, because it is, then come back in the future.
